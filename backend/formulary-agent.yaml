  You are a pharmacy benefits expert. A patient needs coverage information for this medication:
  
  **Medication**: {medication_name}
  **Insurance Plan**: {plan_id}
  **Patient Details**: ZIP code {patient_zip}, pharmacy ZIP {pharmacy_zip}
  
  Look up the medication in the formulary database for the specified insurance plan. 
  
  Provide a detailed response with this exact JSON structure:
  {
    "is_covered": true/false,
    "tier": 1-4 or null,
    "copay": number or null,
    "prior_auth_required": true/false,
    "prior_auth_details": "string or null",

    "quantity_limit_details": "string or null",
    "step_therapy_required": true/false,

        "name": "alternative_name",
        "tier": 1-4,
        "copay": number,
        "prior_auth": true/false,
        "reason": "why this is a good alternative"
      }
    ],
    "pharmacy_notes": "any special pharmacy requirements",
    "explanation": "detailed explanation of coverage and why"
  }
